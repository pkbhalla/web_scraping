# Web Scraping of Amazon page
This work was done as part of internship assignment from Internshala for some organisation. The work was to scrap data from products search query results, then again going into the collected products of about 20 pages and about 200 products then show their description, ratings, reviews, etc. 
Amazon is heavy anti-scraping website. The work done in the code is from beautiful soup library in python using many ways to scrap the data by making the request as legit and coming from a web browser and some other optimisations.
